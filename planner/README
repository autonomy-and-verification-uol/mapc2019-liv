To use the planner you need
1) the planner to be compiled somewhere on your computer
2) change the executable path in the script

NOTE: I've modified the script in such a way that instead of checking the error code of the planner,
it checks for the existence of the file with the plan. Such file is deleted at the end of the script
(the problem file is also deleted, but within a Java method).
